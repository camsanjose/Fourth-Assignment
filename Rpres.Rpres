summary(Titanic)
```


Boxplot of Men and Women, Child and Adult
========================================================

```{r, echo=F}
plot(x=Titanic$Sex, y= Titanic$Freq, col= "seagreen", xlab="Gender", ylab= "Frequency")
```
***
```{r, echo=F}
plot(x=Titanic$Age, y= Titanic$Freq, col= "lightgreen", xlab="Age", ylab= "Frequency")
```

Boxplot of Survivial and Class
========================================================

```{r, echo=F}
plot(x=Titanic$Survived, y= Titanic$Freq, col= "lightblue", xlab="Survived", ylab= "Frequency")
```
***
```{r, echo=F}
plot(x=Titanic$Class, y= Titanic$Freq, col= "lightpink", xlab="Class", ylab= "Frequency")
```


Conclusions 
========================================================
incremental: true 

- There were many more **males** than females in the ship.
- There were much more **adults** than children in the ship.
- There are much more people that did *not* survive, than those who did. 
- There is a higher average of people in **third** class, and a lot more people in crew.
